# Twitter-Feed
The goal of this project is to demonstrate profciency with linked lists. Here, I will model a simple Twitter feed as a linked list of tweets. You can iterate through these tweets in reverse-chronological order, or show only tweets from users with important blue checkmarks, or with only tweets with more than a certain ratio of likes to total interactions.
